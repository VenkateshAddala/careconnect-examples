Examples have been tested using Eclipse Neon IDE for Java Developers.

NOTE: Need N3 connection to run (check by using main swagger interface http://api-ers.spine2.ncrs.nhs.uk:88/swagger-ui/ )

To use the eRS examples you need to have a configured NHS SmartCard reader. This uses a 32 bit dll which means you also require  need to use a 32 bit version of Java SDK. 

eRS is a simple app to connect to E-Referral Service API, eRSSwagger does the same but uses SpringBoot and includes a simple Swagger interface http://127.0.0.1:8181/index.html
